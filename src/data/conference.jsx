            A huge thank you to everyone who attended SET 2019! This event
            wouldn't have been possible without the support of our speakers,
            networkers, volunteers, sponsors and of course, the students! We
            were happy to see so much enthusiasm for engineering from both
            adults and students alike.
            <br />
            <br />
            We started off the day with a keynote speech from Derek Glennie, who
            gave us inspirational insight about practical tips and challenges
            faced by engineers. The next couple of hours passed by in a blur of
            workshops, pizza and networking; we're confident that every single
            person learned something new that morning.
